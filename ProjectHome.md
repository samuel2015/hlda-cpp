This is a C++ re-implementation of David Blei's Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (HLDA) topic modeling software.
The model finds a hierarchy of topics, where the data determines the structure of the hierarchy. The depth of the hierarchy is fixed.

The development was supported by the RENDER EU FP7 project.
